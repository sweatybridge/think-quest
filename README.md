An educational website about the causes and preventive measures for adolescent suicides.

Brief History
=====

This website was built back in 2006 when Flash was still the craze. It went through a major revision to improve the overall aesthetic appeal but I decided to keep both versions for future reference.

* `indexO.html` brings up the old homepage which offers a visitor the choice between the Flash version and the low fidelity version of the website (remember back in the ADSL days bandwidth used to be the limiting factor on page load speed).
* `index.html` loads the new version of the website which is written entirely in Flash.
