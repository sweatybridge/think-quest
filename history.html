Some are confirmed to be suicides, whereas others,  speculations. Some suicides were due to the immense social pressure, whereas  others, the protecting of their interests. There are no records on the first  person who has committed suicide, neither are there records of the total number  of victims to this menace. However, there are several cases which have made a  bigger impact on the world than others.<br />
              <br />
              Feelings, whether arising from a medical  condition or the situation one is in, have been one important factor in the  decision of one committing suicide. This has been seen in many cases, such as  that of famous artist Vincent van Gogh, famous for his cheerful paintings of  sunflowers. Other cases, such as the spate of suicide pacts in Japan can also  be attributed to the social condition of the people who committed suicide.  These people, termed as <em>hikikomori </em>9  10, or social outcasts. They withdraw from the society into  their own recluse, both mentally and physically, cooping themselves up in rooms  to avoid social contact, leading to abnormal tendencies, such as suicide and  the assaulting of parents.<br />
              <br />
              Honour has been another important factor.  This has been seen in cases such as that of the <em>kamikaze</em> pilots who sacrificed their lives to protect their own, or  the nation¡¯s, interests. More recently, suicide bombers have made a comeback,  in the form of non-governmental political groups which have been tagged as  terrorists. The main incident which has shocked the world, the September 11  incident, resulted in the suicides of 19 terrorists, which directly led to the  deaths of thousands more. 11 </p>
